# 🧑‍🎨 Favorite Artist

Who’s your favorite artist?

In a file called favorite_artist.py, write a program in Python that prompts the user to input favorite artist, artist type, favorite work from the artist, and two adjectives on why you like that work, and then outputs a response based on your choices.

You may choose to use some text for an input prompt or leave it empty.

## 💻 Demo


```python
> python favorite_artist.py
Pablo Picasso, painter, Girl before a Mirror, complex, colorful
Pablo Picasso is my favorite painter!
My favorite work from Pablo Picasso is Girl before a Mirror
I love it, because is it is so complex and colorful!
>
```

## 🎏 Before You Begin

### 📄 Make an Empty Code File in a `src` Folder.

1. **Execute** `mkdir src` in your VS Code Terminal, to make a folder called `src` in root folder of your repository.
2. **Run** `cd src` to change directories into that folder. This is where you will save your code (a.k.a. source files).
3. **Execute** `code timelapse_calc.py` to create an empty file called `favorite_artist.py`, where you will code your program.

## ✅ How to Test?

Here’s how to test your code manually. 

In the VS Code terminal, ensure that you are in the `src` folder where your code resides.

- Run the program with `python favorite_artist.py`. Type “Pablo Picasso”, “painter”, “Girl before a Mirror”, “complex”, and “colorful” and press Enter. Your program should output
    
    ```python
    Pablo Picasso is my favorite painter!
    My favorite work from Pablo Picasso is Girl before a Mirror.
    I love it, because is it is so complex and colorful!
    ```
    
- Run the program with `python favorite_artist.py`. Type “P!nk”, “singer”, “Try”, “thought-provoking”, and “meaningful” and press Enter. Your program should output
    
    ```python
    P!nk is my favorite singer!
    My favorite work from P!nk is Try.
    I love it, because is it is so thought-provoking and meaningful!
    ```
    
- Run the program with `python favorite_artist.py`. Type “123”, “ “, “ “, “ “, and “ “ and press Enter. Your program should output
    
    ```python
    123 is my favorite  !
    My favorite work from 123 is  .
    I love it, because is it is so   and   !
    ```
    

If you run into errors saying your file cannot be open, be sure that your current working directory is `src` and that you have saved your `favorite_artist.py` file there.

### 🤖 How Auto Testing Works?

- You can also check your code every time you push your commits to the GitHub repository. An autograding program will test your code whenever you push changes to GitHub.
- Visit the Actions tab on your GitHub repository. You’ll find a list of workflows that ran. Red crosses means some or all tests have failed, a green check box means you passed all tests.
- Click on any of the workflow, then click on “**Autograding**” under Jobs. This will show test details such as why the test failed to help you fix any bugs or issues.

## 📤 How to Submit?

Whenever you push changes to the GitHub repository on the cloud, your work is submitted.

If the Lab Challenge has a deadline, just make sure to push your final changes before the Lab Challenge deadline. You will not be able to push changes to GitHub after the deadline.

To ensure your final changes are on GitHub, please review the code in your GitHub repository as well as the autograde test results after you push your changes from VS Code to GitHub.
